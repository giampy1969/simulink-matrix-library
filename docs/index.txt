The Simulink MatriX Library (SMXL) consists in a collection of blocks 
that allow (varying) matrices to be handled directly in Simulink.

The signals that flow through Simulink connections, which in general are
the only quantities allowed to vary with time, can be scalars or vectors.
It is not permitted to carry a matrix through a connection, that is,
we could certainly carry a p by n matrix as a vector of p*n entries, 
but all the existing Simulink built-in blocks that will process this 
p*n by 1 vector will still treat it just like a vector. 
As a consequence, every time that we have to process the p by n
matrix we have to decompose it into its elements. 
These decompositions, and the successive compositions make it very 
uncomfortable to deal with varying matrices in the Simulink environment.

The smxl library solves this problem, allowing operations like 
matrix multiplication, transposition, and pseudoinversion to be 
performed without any decomposition or type conversion.

The library contains several examples as well as a pdf paper that gives
further details and explains several motivations for using the blocks.  
A library of ROTATION MATRICES which can be very useful 
for simulations of rigid bodies in 3D space, is included.

All blocks are compatible with Real Time Workshop.
Smxl has been developed under Matlab 5.3.1 and tested
under several platforms.

See the file README.TXT for instructions about how to install SMXL.
